## How It Works


### Start The App

For This Project, I created Two Different Apps. The Client App and The Driver App. After creating An Account, Adding A Phone Number, Your Location Is Automatically detected via the google maps geolocation, But You Could Point The Marker Elsewhere To Choose Another Location.

### Request A Taxi

When A User Books A ride, Then User's Details Are Sent To The Database With The Notification Id Of The First Driver Available, Then After 60 seconds And No reply, Then it is shifted To Another driver.

### Get Accepted By A Driver

Once You Get A Driver Then Your Phone Vibrates And The Credentials Of The Driver Appears on Your Screen, As well as The Distance Between You And Your Driver Are Displayed As well.

### Get To Your Destination And Pay Up

On Completion Of the ride your payment reciept is shown to you, then you can check out and rate your ride and then, you are ready for another booking.
